			        	<h3>The Cutest Puppy</h3>
						<p>Today, I walked by the pet store.  I saw a very 
							<span class="blank" id="blank0" title="adjective"></span> puppy.  The puppy was chewing on a(n) 
							<span class="blank" id="blank1" title="singular noun"></span>.  When he saw me, he wagged his tail 
							<span class="blank" id="blank2" title="adverb"></span>. Since he looked so 
							<span class="blank" id="blank3" title="adjective"></span>, I decided to go into the store and give him a pat on the head.  Then I reached into my pocket, and grabbed a(n) 
							<span class="blank" id="blank4" title="singular noun"></span> which I fed him.  He seemed to enjoy it, and he suddenly started to 
							<span class="blank" id="blank5" title="verb"></span> and 
							<span class="blank" id="blank6" title="verb"></span>.  He was such a funny dog, that I decided to name him 
							<span class="blank" id="blank7" title="name of someone in the room"></span>.  When he heard his new name, he immediately began 
							<span class="blank" id="blank8" title="-ing verb"></span> and 
							<span class="blank" id="blank9" title="-ing verb"></span> happily. What a 
							<span class="blank" id="blank10" title="adjective"></span> dog!</p>

						<h3>Marathons</h3>
						<p>If you haven't ever run a marathon, let me explain how 
							<span class="blank" id="blank0" title="adjective"></span> this race really is.  It is 26.2 miles long.  The fastest runners in the world finish the race in less than 2 and a half hours, but other runners finish in about 
							<span class="blank" id="blank1" title="number"></span> hours. When you run a marathon, you can't quit.  No matter how 
							<span class="blank" id="blank2" title="adjective"></span> you feel, you keep 
							<span class="blank" id="blank3" title="-ing verb"></span> and 
							<span class="blank" id="blank4" title="-ing verb"></span> until you've finished all 26.2 
							<span class="blank" id="blank5" title="adjective"></span> miles.  If you've trained enough, you feel pretty 
							<span class="blank" id="blank6" title="adjective"></span> for the first 15 miles.  Then you start getting 
							<span class="blank" id="blank7" title="adjective"></span>.  By mile 18, you're really running out of steam and you start dreaming about 
							<span class="blank" id="blank8" title="plural noun"></span>.  By mile 20, you wonder if your 
							<span class="blank" id="blank9" title="body part"></span> can keep moving, but you still have 6 long miles left.  By mile 23, some people are so 
							<span class="blank" id="blank10" title="adjective"></span> that they start crying.  But they keep going.  Each mile feels 
							<span class="blank" id="blank11" title="comparative adjective"></span> than the last.  If you get dehydrated, you might start hallucinating.  One time while running a marathon, I dreamed I saw a 
							<span class="blank" id="blank12" title="adjective"></span> 
							<span class="blank" id="blank13" title="noun"></span> wearing a 
							<span class="blank" id="blank14" title="noun"></span>. I hope you can see that running a marathon is very 
							<span class="blank" id="blank15" title="adjective"></span>. </p>
